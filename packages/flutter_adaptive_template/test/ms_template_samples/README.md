# Samples from the old web site

<https://adaptivecards.io/samples> Different than what was in their public GitHub repository

The output json from the template designer on the web site can return a different version number and can change the case of some of the values for some of the properties.  We edited the output and template versions to have matching values.  We also lowercased all the string values in the output json to make it easier to compare with the template json.
