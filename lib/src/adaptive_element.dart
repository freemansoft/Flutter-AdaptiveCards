/// - [generateWidget()] is called every time the elements needs to render
/// this method should be as lightweight as possible because it could possibly
/// be called many times (for example in an animation). The method should also be

/// return the same result

/// This class also holds some references every element needs.

/// leaf):
/// implement the method [visitChildren] and call visitor(this) in addition call
/// [visitChildren] on each child with the passed visitor.

  ///      super.generateWidget(),
